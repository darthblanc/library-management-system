# Library Management System

A library management system built in Java, featuring custom implementations of various data structures and a text file-based database implementation.

## Overview

This Library Management System is built using Java and demonstrates the practical application of data structures and algorithms. The application uses custom implementations of data structures and delivers expected functionality of a library management system, with data persistence handled through text files.

## Features

- **Custom Data Structures**: Hand-built implementations of various data structures
- **Text-Based Database**: Uses .txt files for data storage
- **Java Implementation**: Built entirely in Java
